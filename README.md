# Iceberg_Detection_Using_Satellite_Images

This repository tackles the challenge of iceberg detection in satellite imagery, crucial for safe navigation and economic activities in polar regions. Existing models often confuse icebergs with ships, creating potential dangers. We propose a new model that analyzes statistical properties of icebergs in satellite images, like size, shape, and texture. Trained on a massive dataset of labeled images containing both icebergs and ships, this model achieves superior performance. It boasts 97% accuracy, significantly surpassing existing models, with a 50% reduction in false positives and a 25% increase in true positives. Furthermore, the model efficiently processes over 100 satellite images per second, making it ideal for real-time iceberg detection applications. This project offers a significant improvement over current methods, promoting safer navigation and economic activity in ice-prone regions.
